# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Purpose

The purpose of this project was to provide a visual representation of the data of earthquakes across the world and their magnitudes. This data can be examined and filtered using a world map with three separate views and filters for all earthquakes, major earthquakes, and also includes the outlines of tectonic plates.
